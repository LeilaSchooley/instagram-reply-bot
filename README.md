# Instagram Bot with OpenAI Integration

This Python-based bot logs into Instagram, checks for new messages, waits for a specified time, reads the message, generates a reply using OpenAI's API (like ChatGPT), and types out the response to mimic human behavior.

## Features

- **Login to Instagram** using credentials stored in a `config.ini` file.
- **Check for new messages** in your Instagram inbox.
- **Wait 5 minutes** before opening the message.
- **Send the message to OpenAI** to generate a reply.
- **Type the reply out** as if a human is typing (no copy-pasting).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `openai` Python package for AI-generated replies.
- `playwright` for browser automation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository or Download Files

If you havenâ€™t already, download or clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/instagram-openai-bot.git
cd instagram-openai-bot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated. To create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to start using it.

- **On Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, install Playwright's browser dependencies:

```bash
playwright install
```

### 5. Configure Credentials

You need to set up a configuration file (`config.ini`) to store your credentials and API keys.

Create a file named `config.ini` in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```ini
[openai]
api_key = your-openai-api-key

[instagram]
username = your-instagram-username
password = your-instagram-password
```

- Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.
- Replace `your-instagram-username` and `your-instagram-password` with your Instagram credentials.

### 6. Run the Bot

Once everything is set up, run the bot by executing the following command:

```bash
python bot.py
```

### 7. What the Bot Does

- **Login**: The bot will log in to your Instagram account using the credentials from `config.ini`.
- **Inbox Monitoring**: It will check the Instagram inbox for any messages that are 5 minutes old.
- **Read and Generate Reply**: After reading the message, it sends the content to OpenAI, which generates a reply.
- **Human-like Typing**: The bot types out the reply as if a person were doing it, then sends the message.

## Files Overview

- **`bot.py`**: The main script that runs the bot.
- **`config.ini`**: The file where you store sensitive information like your OpenAI API key and Instagram credentials (make sure not to share this).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the list of Python packages required to run the bot.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides setup instructions and usage information.

## Notes

- **Security**: Ensure your Instagram account is secure, and be cautious with automation to avoid account restrictions or bans.
- **OpenAI Usage**: Make sure your OpenAI account is active and you are aware of any token or usage limits.
- **Bot Limitations**: The bot currently waits for 5-minute-old messages to respond. You can modify the waiting time in the script.
